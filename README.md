- `templates/index.html`: Web UI form for user input.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies file.
- `logs/app.log`: Logs for incoming requests and errors.
- `model.pkl`, `scaler.pkl`, `label_encoders.pkl`, `feature_names.pkl`: Machine learning assets (to be added manually).

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone this repository or unzip the downloaded folder.
2. Make sure your Python environment is set up.
3. Install all required dependencies:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
